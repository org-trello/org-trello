- At the moment, need to create the card first
- Then hit again, this will create the checklists
- Then hit again, this will create the tasks
Why? Do not know why yet!

- Limit: I had to make the http request synchronous

** DONE Make an interactive setup for retrieving the consumer key and the secret-token and generate it inside ~/.trello/config.el
CLOSED: [2013-07-03 mer. 23:30]
This will ease the installation of the *config.el* file
- M-x install-orgtrello
- Open the browser on https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate
- Let the user retrieve the consumer-key and input it in the modeline.
- Open the browser on https://trello.com/1/authorize?response_type=token&name=org-trello&scope=read,write&expiration=never&key=<consumer-key>
- Prompt for the user to input its token
- Generate the following file *~/.trello/config.el*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; from: https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate
(defvar consumer-key "<consumer-key>")
;; from: https://trello.com/1/authorize?response_type=token&name=org-trello&scope=read,write&expiration=never&key=<consumer-key>

** DONE Make an interactive setup for retrieving the list ids of the board
CLOSED: [2013-07-04 jeu. 15:32]
This will ease the installation of the list-ids in top of the org file.
Workflow:
- M-x orgtrello-do-install-board-and-lists - interactive command to install the board and list ids
- Make a request to list the board ids (name + ids), and display them on a buffer.
- Prompt for the user to choose the board-id he wants
- Retrieve the todo, doing and done id list
- Generate the different metadata needed in the org-mode file
#+begin_src txt
# +property: board-id      <board-id>
# +property: todo-list-id  <todo-list-id>
# +property: doing-list-id <doing-list-id>
# +property: done-list-id  <done-list-id>
#+end_src
Note: # + instead of #+ because otherwise, org-mode captures them and overwrite the right ones.

** TODO Assign yourself to the card?
Is this really usefull?

** TODO Release in marmalade the tags
** TODO If no level 3, we may create a dummy checklist and attach every todo to such dummy checklist
* Questions
** How to deal with promotion/demotion?
We do not deal with it at the moment.
Idea: - demotion: remove the card and add the checklist or the task to the card if need be
      - promotion: remove the checklist and create the card if need be
      - promotion: the item and create the checklist if need be
???

Dependencies:
- Delete must be implemented.
- Create with full arborescence from the current level must also be implemented.

** Import - Existing and compatible org-mode file into trello?
** Export - Existing trello board into org-mode file?
* TODO card for testing
