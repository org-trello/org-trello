**** DONE code the id to look for depending on the state
CLOSED: [2013-07-02 mar. 18:43]
** DONE Adding org metadata file `a la` #+BOARD-ID, #+TODO-LIST-ID, #+DOING-LIST-ID, #+DONE-LIST-ID to permit the user to setup easily without touching lisp code
CLOSED: [2013-07-01 lun. 23:31]
Adding this:
#+begin_src org-mode
# +property: board-id      <board-id>
# +property: todo-list-id  <todo-list-id>
# +property: doing-list-id <doing-list-id>
# +property: done-list-id  <done-list-id>
#+end_src
Note: # + instead of #+ to avoid org-mode capturing the bad ones.

** DONE Make orgtrello a minor mode for org-mode
CLOSED: [2013-07-02 mar. 16:36]
** DONE create/update trello card from top (card) to bottom (items)
CLOSED: [2013-07-02 mar. 22:24]
*** DONE Retrieve all the list - org-map-tree
CLOSED: [2013-07-02 mar. 22:20]
*** DONE A binding to describe the extraction of all data
CLOSED: [2013-07-02 mar. 22:21]
*** DONE Trigger the creation of the card and every level up to 3 (checklist + task)
CLOSED: [2013-07-03 mer. 14:15]
- At the moment, need to create the card first
- Then hit again, this will create the checklists
- Then hit again, this will create the tasks
Why? Do not know why yet!

- Limit: I had to make the http request synchronous

** DONE Improve the callback (at the moment, the id is written where the carret is, so if we move while a http request takes place, the id is written badly)
CLOSED: [2013-07-03 mer. 00:47]
** DONE Improve the id generation and use the properties instead of tags (cf. org2blog)
CLOSED: [2013-07-03 mer. 01:25]

** DONE Make an interactive setup for retrieving the consumer key and the secret-token and generate it inside ~/.trello/config.el
CLOSED: [2013-07-03 mer. 23:30]
This will ease the installation of the *config.el* file
- M-x install-orgtrello
- Open the browser on https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate
- Let the user retrieve the consumer-key and input it in the modeline.
- Open the browser on https://trello.com/1/authorize?response_type=token&name=org-trello&scope=read,write&expiration=never&key=<consumer-key>
- Prompt for the user to input its token
- Generate the following file *~/.trello/config.el*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; from: https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate
(defvar consumer-key "<consumer-key>")
;; from: https://trello.com/1/authorize?response_type=token&name=org-trello&scope=read,write&expiration=never&key=<consumer-key>
(defvar access-token "<access-token>")
#+end_src
- Display what has been done to the user's filesystem by showing the content of *~/.trello/config.el*.

** DONE Make an interactive setup for retrieving the list ids of the board
CLOSED: [2013-07-04 jeu. 15:32]
This will ease the installation of the list-ids in top of the org file.
Workflow:
- M-x orgtrello-do-install-board-and-lists - interactive command to install the board and list ids
- Make a request to list the board ids (name + ids), and display them on a buffer.
- Prompt for the user to choose the board-id he wants
- Retrieve the todo, doing and done id list
- Generate the different metadata needed in the org-mode file
#+begin_src txt
# +property: board-id      <board-id>
# +property: todo-list-id  <todo-list-id>
# +property: doing-list-id <doing-list-id>
# +property: done-list-id  <done-list-id>
#+end_src
Note: # + instead of #+ because otherwise, org-mode captures them and overwrite the right ones.
** DONE Control the access to the function depending on the ~/.trello/config.el file.
CLOSED: [2013-07-04 jeu. 18:25]
** DONE Control the access to the function depending on the properties board-id, todo-list-id, etc...

* 0.1.5 [%]
** TODO POC: use a temporary buffer to sync with trello, when done, merge with the user's buffer.
** TODO Ensure sync-from-trello keep the order of the checklists clean
** TODO Now that elnode is here, this may be simpler to use a fake trello server (use clojure :D)
** TODO Improve the request to the trello api to enforce the position inside trello (we can use the natural order of integer with position to determine such position)
** TODO Filter out directly with the api the data we do not need to avoid unnecessary network traffic
** TODO Update the literate org-trello.org (completely desynchronized since 0.1.2) -> code something to avoid doing manual split
* TODO Very Interesting propositions
- https://github.com/ardumont/org-trello/issues/14 - Using org's native checklist functionality (Now that the proxy is here, it is simply a matter of speaking the right language -> parsing)
- https://github.com/ardumont/org-trello/issues/33 - Another Disposition about org's buffer
- https://github.com/ardumont/org-trello/issues/37#issuecomment-23033199 - One command to sync them all
* Questions
** How to deal with promotion/demotion?
We do not deal with it at the moment.
Idea: - demotion: remove the card and add the checklist or the task to the card if need be
      - promotion: remove the checklist and create the card if need be
      - promotion: the item and create the checklist if need be
???

Dependencies:
- Delete must be implemented.
- Create with full arborescence from the current level must also be implemented.
** How to deal with synchronizing the org-mode buffer and the trello board without a synchronized request?
** Is the assignment to one's card necessary?
** if there is no level 3 (items), can't we just create a dummy checklist with all the second level as items?
