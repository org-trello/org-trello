# rationale

- [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) is what I need.
- [Trello](http://trello.com/) is what my team need.
- [org-trello](https://github.com/ardumont/org-trello) is the middle ground!

This will satisfy org-modians and trelloans won't see any difference!

# Emacs version

Tested on:
- GNU Emacs 24.1.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, Xaw3d scroll bars) of 2012-09-22 on batsu, modified by Debian (<= 0.0.9)
- GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, Xaw3d scroll bars) of 2013-04-14 on marid, modified by Debian (from 0.1.0)

# Migration

0.1.5 -> 0.1.6

Org-trello now uses more natural ways of dealing with checklists using checkboxes!

cf. [natural org format (from 0.1.6 onwards)](#natural-org-format-from-016-onwards) for more details.

0.1.1 -> 0.1.2:
- From version 0.1.1, some http requests will be asynchronous.
For this, we use elnode as a proxy server to make requests to trello.
The elnode server is started on the port 9876.
You can always change this port

``` lisp
(setq *ORGTRELLO-PROXY-PORT* 9876)
```
Then `M-x orgtrello-proxy/reload`

# TL;DR

## Fast setup

Yank this into a scratch buffer:
``` lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
;; or (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
(package-install 'org-trello)
(require 'org-trello)
;; to trigger org-trello for each org file
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-trello-mode)

```
then `M-x eval-buffer`

Now open an org-mode buffer, then hit: `C-c o h`

# Install

## marmalade - Stable version

Add this to your emacs's init file (~/.emacs, ~/.emacs.d/init.el, or *scratch*, or whatnot...)

``` lisp
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))

(package-initialize)
```

Then hit `M-x eval-buffer` to evaluate the buffer's contents.

## melpa - ~snapshot

Add this to your emacs's init file (~/.emacs, ~/.emacs.d/init.el, or *scratch*, or whatnot...)

``` lisp
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)

(package-initialize)
```

Then hit `M-x eval-buffer` to evaluate the buffer's contents.

## org-trello

To install org-trello:

``` lisp
(when (not package-archive-contents)
  (package-refresh-contents))

;; Add in your own as you wish:
(defvar my-packages '(org-trello)
  "A list of packages to ensure are installed at launch.")

(dolist (p my-packages)
  (when (not (package-installed-p p))
    (package-install p)))
```

Again hit `M-x eval-buffer`.

## github

Download org-trello from GitHub

```sh
git clone http://github.com/ardumont/org-trello.git
```

Add the org-trello directory to your load path and then add

``` lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-trello/"))
(require 'org-trello)
```

## Example

- [Adding emacs repository](https://github.com/ardumont/install-packages-pack/blob/master/init.el)
- [Installing org-trello](https://github.com/ardumont/orgmode-pack/blob/master/init.el#L1)

# Setup

## Emacs related

Org-trello is a minor mode for org-mode to sync.
Add this somewhere in your load file (`~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`).

``` lisp
(require 'org-trello)
;; to have org-trello activated for all org file, uncomment this
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-trello-mode)
;; otherwise, M-x org-trello-mode
```

For example, here is my [startup file](https://github.com/ardumont/orgmode-pack/blob/master/init.el#L3).

## Trello related

### keys

Install the consumer-key and the read-write token for org-trello to be able to work in your name with your trello boards.
First, ensure that the web browser that emacs is configured to use is started, and you are logged in to Trello in it.

Then, from an org-mode buffer:

`C-c o i`

or in any mode:

``` lisp
M-x org-trello/install-key-and-token
```

### Sync org to trello

#### Sync your org-mode buffer

For each org-mode file, you need to connect your org-mode file with a trello board.

`C-c o I`

or

``` lisp
M-x org-trello/install-board-and-lists-ids
```

A simpler way could be to create a board from scratch (if you can).

### Create a board

You can avoid the previous step and create directly a board from your org-mode file.
This will create the list from the keywords you use in your org-mode (cf. [org-todo-keywords](http://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-settings.html)).

`C-c o b`

or

``` lisp
M-x org-trello/create-board
```

# Use cases

## Setup

1. open an org-mode file

2. Install the key and the token file (`C-c o i` or `M-x org-trello/install-key-and-token`).
This will open your browser to retrieve the needed information (`consumer-key` then the `access-token`) and wait for your input in emacs.

*Remark:* This only needs to be done once, until you revoke the token.

3. Setup your org-mode file with your trello board (`C-c o I` or `M-x org-trello/install-board-and-lists-ids`).
This will present you with a list of your actual boards. Select the one you want and hit enter.
This will edit your org-mode file to add the properties needed.

*Remarks:*
- This need to be done once for each org-mode file you want to sync with a trello board.
- You can directly create a board (`C-c o b` or `M-x orgtrello/do-create-board-and-lists`)

Now you are ready to use org-mode as usual.

## Formats

There is a new setup which is activated by default, using the natural org [checkboxes](http://orgmode.org/manual/Checkboxes.html).
Thanks to @sw1nn [for showing me this org feature, this is awesome!](https://github.com/ardumont/org-trello/issues/14).

### natural org format (from 0.1.6 onwards)

Activated by default.

```org-mode
- [-] LISP
  - [X] Emacs-Lisp
  - [X] Common-Lisp
  - [ ] Scheme
  - [X] Clojure
- [X] ML
  - [X] Haskell
  - [X] Ocaml
- [X] Hybrid
  - [X] Scala
- [ ] little more detail, this is level 2, so checklist in trello board
  - [ ] item 3
    - [ ] any entities with level superior to 4 are considered level 3
```

For example, once synced to trello, this looks like:

```
* IN-PROGRESS Joy of FUN(ctional) LANGUAGES

```

#### Migrate to 0.1.6

To migrate your 0.1.6 org trello buffer to the new format:
- simply push the content to trello (`C-c o s`)
- Erase the content of your buffer except for the org-trello properties (`#+` entries at the beginning of the file)
- and sync from trello again (`C-c o S`).

#### Reactivate

This is activated by default but if you change this and you want to get back:

```lisp
(org-trello/activate-natural-org-checkboxes)
```

### Original format (previous to 0.1.6)

```org-mode
* IN-PROGRESS Joy of FUN(ctional) LANGUAGES
** TODO LISP
*** DONE Emacs-Lisp
*** DONE Common-Lisp
*** Scheme
*** TODO Clojure
** DONE ML

*** DONE Ocaml
** DONE Hybrid
*** DONE Scala
** A little more explanation, this is level 2 so checklist on trello
*** item (level 3)
**** Any entity superior to level 4 are not considered for sync
```

Once synchronized, this looks like (largely prettier in emacs org buffer):

```org-mode
* IN-PROGRESS Joy of FUN(ctional) LANGUAGES
:PROPERTIES:
:orgtrello-id: 521dc9f3edeabee47600401e

```

#### Activate

From 0.1.6 onwards, if you want to deactivate the default way, and get back to the original way, put this snippet somewhere in your init file:

```lisp
(org-trello/deactivate-natural-org-checkboxes)
```

## Creation step-by-step

Basically, you have 3 levels (cf. [possible formats](#formats))
- level 1 - Card
- level 2 - Checklist
- level 3 - Item

Steps:
- Card:
  - Place yourself on the `card-identity` and hit the binding `C-c o c`, this will sync the card (create) in the `TODO` column in your trello board.
  - You can edit the label and hit `C-c o c` again, this time, this will sync the card again (update) in trello
  - Change the status from TODO to any intermediary status, then hit the binding, this will move the card to the list `DOING` (depending on your todo keywords list).
  - Once done, move the status of the card from anything to DONE, hit the binding, this will move the card to the list `DONE`.

- Checklist:
  - Place yourself on the checklist `checklist`, hit the binding, this will add `checklist` as a checklist to your card `card-identity`
  - Rename your checklist and hit again the binding to update its label.

- Item:
  - Place yourself on your item and hit the binding, this will add the item to such checklist.
  - Change the label of the item and hit the binding, this will update its label.
  - Change the status of the item to `DONE` and hit the binding, this will check such item in trello.

## Card and deadline/due date

You can use [org-mode's deadline](http://orgmode.org/manual/Inserting-deadline_002fschedule.html), this is mapped to trello's due date notion during the synchronize step.

## Creation of a full entity

You can sync all the entities and their arborescence once.
Place yourself on the entity (card or checklist or item) and hit `C-c o C`.

## Sync org-mode file to trello board

You can sync all your org-mode file to trello.
Hit `C-c o s`.

## Sync org-mode file from trello board

You can sync the content of your trello board into an org-mode file.
Hit `C-c o S`.

This will update any entries that were already present in the org-mode file and create any entries that were not created yet.

## Remove entity

You can remove any entity and its arborescence from the board with `C-c o k`.
This will also remove the entry from the org-mode buffer.

## Remove entities

You can remove all entities from the board `C-c o K`.
This will also remove the entries from the org-mode buffer.

## Cleanup org-trello setup

You can remove all data from the org-mode buffer with `C-c o x`.
This will remove any org-trello related entries in your file (headers included).

# Errors

Here are the possible error messages you can get if trying to sync in bad conditions:

- without setting up the consumer-key and the access-token:
```
 - Setup problem - You need to install the consumer-key and the read/write access-token - C-c o i or M-x org-trello/install-board-and-lists-ids
```

- without setting up the org-mode buffer:
```
 - Setup problem.
Either you did not connect your org-mode buffer with a trello board, to correct this:
  * attach to a board through C-c o I or M-x org-trello/install-board-and-lists-ids
  * or create a board from scratch with C-c o b or M-x org-trello/create-board).
Either your org-mode's todo keyword list and your trello board lists are not named the same way (which they must).
For this, connect to trello and rename your board's list according to your org-mode's todo list.
Also, you can specify on your org-mode buffer the todo list you want to work with, for example: #+TODO: TODO DOING | DONE FAIL (hit C-c C-c to refresh the setup)
```

- If the board's list names are different from your org-mode's keyword list:

```
 - Setup problem.
Either you did not connect your org-mode buffer with a trello board, to correct this:
  * attach to a board through C-c o I or M-x org-trello/install-board-and-lists-ids

```

- no label on the card:
```
Cannot synchronize the card - missing mandatory label. Skip it...
```

- no label on the checklist:
```
Cannot synchronize the checklist - missing mandatory label. Skip it...
```

- no label on the item:
```
Cannot synchronize the item - missing mandatory label. Skip it...
```

- syncing the checklist without syncing the card first:
```
Cannot synchronize the checklist - the card must synchronized first. Skip it...
```

- syncing the item without syncing the checklist first:
```
Cannot synchronize the item - the checklist must be synchronized first. Skip it...
```

# proxy-admin

From version 0.1.2 onwards, there is a proxy which is in charge of:
- consuming the synchronization of the entities
- requesting that Trello do other actions too
